**Never** under any circumstances clone a repo, put your Facebook credentials into it, then run it.

If you want to use this script, take a good look at the files and see what's going on. This script will create a real session and log into a user's profile to retrieve photos. Use with caution, and more importantly, read Facebook's [Automated Data Collection Terms](https://www.facebook.com/apps/site_scraping_tos_terms.php) before use.
